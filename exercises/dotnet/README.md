__Setting up__

Install visual studio community 2019, select `.net desktop` as one of the install modules.
If you are limited for bandwidth then speak to your mentor about what you can trim from the install. You only need .NET core packages and maybe the JIT debugger.

If you've already installed visual studio then make sure it is added through this menu
`Tools --> Get tools and features --> .NET Desktop`

__Running the tests__

Open this project in visual studio and then open the appropiate solution file for each exercise.
There is a test solution for each exercise, right click and `Run Tests`
